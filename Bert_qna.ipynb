This medicine works by attacking the bacteria that cause these pimples.Acnesol Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor. You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment.Common side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away.It is a safe medicine, but you should inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines). Also, inform the doctor if you have ever had bloody diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.Ambrodil Syrup is used for treating various respiratory tract disorders associated with excessive mucus. It works by thinning and loosens mucus in the nose, windpipe and lungs and make it easier to cough out.Ambrodil Syrup should be taken with food. For better results, it is suggested to take it at the same time every day.  The dose and how often you take it depends on what you are taking it for. Your doctor will decide how much you need to improve your symptoms.  It is advised not to use it for more than 14 days without doctor consultation.The most common side effects of this medicine include vomiting, nausea, and stomach upset. Talk to your doctor if you are worried about side effects or they would not go away. Generally, it is advised not to take alcohol while on treatment.Before taking this medicine, tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease or if you have stomach problems. Your doctor should also know about all other medicines you are taking as many of these may make this medicine less effective or change the way it works. You must take doctor's advice before using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\"\n",
